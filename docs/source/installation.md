Cerberus currently requires a few features that I had to add to [PyRanges](https://github.com/biocore-ntnu/pyranges)
and [Matplotlib ternary](https://github.com/marcharper/python-ternary). Install
my versions of each library using the following:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fairliereese/pyranges.git
cd pyranges
pip install .
cd ../

git clone git@github.com:fairliereese/python-ternary.git
cd python-ternary
pip install .
```
