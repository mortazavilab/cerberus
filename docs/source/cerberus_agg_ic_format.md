* Coordinates is a `-`-separated list of the internal splice sites used
* Monoexonic transcripts are assigned the coordinate `-`
* Sources are comma-separated if there was more than one form of support for the intron chain.
* Novelty of the intron chain is determined with respect to the sources used as references. Those supported are `Known`. Others are assigned a [SQANTI novelty category](https://github.com/ConesaLab/SQANTI3/wiki/SQANTI3-isoform-classification:-categories-and-subcategories) (ISM, NIC, NNC, and Unspliced).
