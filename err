      CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
        Could not find a package configuration file provided by "LLVM" with any of
        the following names:
      
          LLVMConfig.cmake
          llvm-config.cmake
      
        Add the installation prefix of "LLVM" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
        "LLVM_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "LLVM"
        provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
        installed.
